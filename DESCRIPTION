Description: R implementation of the software tools developed in the H-CUP
    (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project) <https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov>
    and AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality)
    <https://www.ahrq.gov>.  It currently contains functions for mapping ICD-9
    codes to the AHRQ comorbidity measures and translating ICD-9
    (resp. ICD-10) codes to ICD-10 (resp. ICD-9) codes based on GEM (General
    Equivalence Mappings) from CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
    Services).
